            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nelly.
                <br></br>
                ​I'm currently enrolled in Human Computer Interaction and User Experience master's program at Drexel University.
                My interest in UX/UI design began when I was working on a few personal and professional projects. The simplicity and creativity of a design for a system or a product captured my attention because small changes increased user experience dramatically. The journey inspired me to create systems with a user in mind and it helped me to excel at my day-to-day work. My goal is one day to be a Director of User Experience and UX department.</p>
            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a>Personal Growth</a></li>
                <li><a>Business & Investing</a></li>
                <li><a>Building Systems</a></li>
                <li><a>Leadership and Training</a></li>
                <li><a>Music</a></li>
                <li><a>Design</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Personal growth, business and investing, building systems, and leadership are integral aspects of my life that continually fuel my enthusiasm and drive for success. My dedication to personal growth stems from a profound belief in lifelong learning and self-improvement. I relish the challenge of acquiring new skills, embracing diverse perspectives, and evolving into the best version of myself.</p>

            <p>In the realm of business and investing, I am captivated by the dynamic nature of markets and the strategic decisions that shape successful enterprises. Studying market trends, exploring investment opportunities, and understanding financial mechanisms form the core of my interests. I am committed to mastering the art of financial literacy and leveraging this knowledge to make informed and impactful investment choices.</p>
                
            <p>Building systems is a passion that aligns with my innate curiosity and problem-solving mindset. Whether it involves developing efficient workflows, optimizing processes, or creating innovative solutions, I find joy in constructing systems that enhance productivity and effectiveness. This interest extends to both technological and organizational systems, where I explore ways to integrate cutting-edge technologies and foster collaborative environments.</p>
                
            <p>Leadership, for me, is not just a role but a philosophy that emphasizes inspiration, mentorship, and empowerment. I am deeply invested in honing leadership skills to guide and motivate teams towards shared goals. Recognizing the importance of effective communication, strategic decision-making, and fostering a positive work culture, I strive to embody the principles of leadership in every aspect of my personal and professional life. These four pillars—personal growth, business and investing, building systems, and leadership—constitute the compass that guides my journey toward continuous improvement and success.</p>
            <p>Lastly, music has been a part of my life and music is everywhere we go. Hence, I start my morning with a quiet time with a journal, a cup of coffee and a smooth jazz.</p>

                Engaging in a diverse array of hobbies adds a rich tapestry to my life, with each activity serving as a unique thread in the fabric of my interests. Reading transports me to different worlds, offering a sanctuary for exploration and imagination. Music, with its varied melodies, is a constant companion, providing solace and inspiration. The simple act of walking allows me to connect with nature, grounding my thoughts and fostering mindfulness. Camping becomes an adventure, an escape into the wilderness that rejuvenates my spirit. Painting and drawing are expressive outlets, where I translate emotions and experiences into visual art. Cooking is a sensory journey, a delightful fusion of creativity and flavors. Traveling unveils new perspectives, broadening my horizons with each destination. Finally, the art of relaxing my mind, whether through meditation or quiet contemplation, allows me the space to think, reflect, and appreciate the beauty of life. Together, these hobbies form a mosaic of joy and fulfillment in my daily existence.</p>
